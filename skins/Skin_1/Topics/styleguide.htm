	<h3>Body Copy and Paragraph Tags</h3>
	<p>This is a block of body copy. Font size and line length were chosen for ease of readability. The fact is, human beings as a species have survived for hundreds of thousands of years and have populated the widest geographical range of any species in large part because our dietary needs are met so readily with the foods generally available to us.<sup>1</sup> Personal eating choices such as vegetarianism, veganism and pescetarianism aside (for the moment), human beings are omnivores, shaped by millions of years of evolution to thrive on a much wider range of foods than other animals.</p>
	<h3>Em, Strong, Subscript, Superscript, Anchors (links) &amp; Citations</h3>

Use the &#39;p&#39; tag to layout blocks of body copy. <em>TheElements of Typographic Style</em> is a book by Canadian typographer, poet and translator Robert Bringhurst <strong>use the &#39;strong&#39; tag for bold elements</strong>. <em>Use the &#39;em&#39; tag for italicized or to emphasize text.</em> Originally published in1992 by Hartley &amp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartley_%26_Marks_Publishers" target="_blank">Marks Publishers</a>, it was revised in 1996, 2001 (v2.4), 2002 (v2.5), 2004(v3.0), 2005 (v3.1), and 2008 (v3.2). A history and guide to typography, it has been praised by Hermann Zapf, who said &ldquo;I wish to see this book become the Typographers&rsquo; Bible.&rdquo;<sup>1</sup> JonathanHoefler and Tobias Frere-Jones consider it "the finest book ever written about typography," accordingto the FAQ section of their type foundry&#39;s website.<sup>2</sup> Because of its widespread use, it issometimes <sub>this is subscript</sub>abbreviated simply as <strong>Bringhurst</strong>.</p>
	<p><cite><sup>1</sup>This is a citation or footnote. It uses the html &#39;cite&#39; tag. Use the html &#39;sup&#39;tag to create the number style. This is a dream for disclaimers as well. Use this for footnotes andcitations and google just might share a little love with you.</cite></p>
	<h3>Other Useful Tags for Content</h3>

	<h3>Blockquotes</h3>
	<p>Use blockquotes for quoting or indenting text. You can also use the &#39;cite&#39; tag and the &#39;title&#39; attributes to be more descriptive.</p>
	<blockquote>
		This is blockquote text. Use the blockquote html tag to indent blocks of text, or forquotes or to draw attention to a snippet of content.</blockquote>
	<blockquote cite="Jonathan Hoefler, Elements of Typographic Style">
		<h3>"I wish to see this book become the Typographers&rsquo; Bible"</h3>
		<h4>-Jonathan Hoefler</h4>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Related (X)HTML elements include the q and cite elements for shorter, probably in-line, quotations and for citations respectively. An (X)HTML attribute specific to the blockquote and q elements is cite= where the provenance of the material quoted may be given. If the quotation is in a language other than that of the main document, lang= and maybe dir= attributes may be relevant to specify the language of the quoted text and perhaps its direction, left-to-right or right-to-left.</p>
